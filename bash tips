# Smart commands in bash is very practcal and sexy way to do things. My prefered is {,}

# Backup some file in the boring way
cp file.conf file.conf.20150810
# the sexy way
cp file.conf{,20150810}

# or mv file.conf.sample file.conf  // remove .sample
mv file.conf{.sample,}

# To run the same command again 
!!
 
## To run the last command again as root user
sudo !!
 
 
 # Run the most recent command beginning with "service" as root  ( I prefer ctrol+r)
sudo !service

The !$ use to run command with the last argument of the most recent command:

# find nginx.conf
ls -la  /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
 
# can edit file  with vi
sudo vi !$

Home sweet home

Want to go the directory you were just in? Run:
cd -

Need to quickly return to your home directory? Enter:
cd


The variable CDPATH defines the search path for the directory containing directories:

export CDPATH=/var/www:/nas10
Now, instead of typing cd /var/www/html/ I can simply type the following to cd into /var/www/html path:

cd html


Text formatting

You can reformat each paragraph with fmt command. In this example, I'm going to reformat file by wrapping overlong lines and filling short lines:

fmt file.txt
You can also split long lines, but do not refill i.e. wrap overlong lines, but do not fill short lines:

fmt -s file.txt

Quickly find differences between two directories

The diff command compare files line by line. It can also compare two directories:

ls -l /tmp/r
ls -l /tmp/s
# Compare two folders using diff ##
diff /tmp/r/ /tmp/s/

See the output and write it to a file

Use the tee command as follows to see the output on screen and also write to a log file named my.log:

mycoolapp arg1 arg2 input.file | tee my.log
The tee command ensures that you will see mycoolapp output on on the screen and to a file same time.
